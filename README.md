The day I will never Forget
It was a one bright cool morning when the birds were flying in the singing with sweet melodies
when I woke up with exitement because my friends and I had plan to go for a birthday party in the
next district. Little did I know that my mum knew all my plans since I was on a phone call with one
of my friends planning where we were going to meet before we could set off for the party.
Everything started off perfectly, The sky was clear and the air was so warm and everyone was
smartly dressed since I and my friends bought new trending outfits for the party. On reaching the
party, the place was lovely, childrens chasing baloons, music floating through the air and laughters
echoing all around and the programs had started. Everyone was enjoying the party with much fun
and entertainment.
As the sun began to set, painting the sky in shadows of orange and pink when the sound
and laughter filled the air, it felt like the happiest moments since I always enjoy having funs with
friends little did I know the happiness can turn into fear in just a heartbeat. Only to turn around, I
saw my mum standing with two police officers. I realized my heart had started to beat harder and
harder. Out of fear, I removed my heels and took off before my mum could speak any word. My
mum ordered the police officers to run after me and that's when I realized that I was talented
because the police officers chased after me but they couldn't get me.
The day turned in to night, I couldn't go back home because I was scared of my mum and
decided to go over to my aunt's place to spend the night. Luckily, my aunt was on my side and
brought me home in the morning. My aunt explained to my mum and the fact that it was my first
time, I was told to appologise and promised them never to go for any party without their
permission.
